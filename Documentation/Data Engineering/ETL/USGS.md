## Discarded Columns 🗑️

While we cherish the abundant data, some columns didn't make it to the final cut. They bid us farewell for the following reasons:

### Code ❌

Removed due to its overly specific nature. We prefer versatile insights over narrow pathways!

### Depth Error ❌

Removed as it relates to the quality of an unused column (depth). Let's keep our data tidy!

### Detail ❌

Removed due to its specificity. Sometimes less detail makes data exploration more exciting!

### Felt ❌

Removed due to highly specific information. We prefer broader perspectives!

### Gap ❌

Removed because it measures the quality of an unused column (horizontalPos). Let's streamline!

### Horizontal Error ❌

Removed because it measures the quality of an unused column (horizontalPos). Data clarity is the way to go!

### ID ❌

Removed due to excessive specificity. It didn't provide valuable insights for our analysis.

### IDs ❌

Removed due to excessive specificity. We're all about efficiency in data representation!

### MagError ❌

Removed because it only provides quality information for a single data point (mag). We're after the bigger picture!

### MagType ❌

Removed because it contains irrelevant information for our analysis. Let's focus on the essentials!

### MagSource ❌

Removed because it contains irrelevant information for our analysis. We seek meaningful data!

### Net ❌

Removed due to excessive specificity. We're embracing inclusivity!

### NST ❌

Removed because it contains irrelevant information for our analysis. Not every detail makes the cut!

### RMS ❌

Removed due to its lack of utility in our analysis. We prefer a clean and straightforward approach!

### Sources ❌

Removed due to excessively incomplete data. Robust sources are the key to reliable analysis!

### Status ❌

Removed due to lack of relevance to our current topic. We're on a focused data journey!

### Title ❌

Removed because it contains redundant information. Clear and concise is our style!

### Types ❌

Removed due to lack of information about provided values. We crave meaningful and interpretable data!

### TZ ❌

Removed as a consequence of previous decisions. We value clarity in our data!

### Updated ❌

Removed because it provides information about the website from which the data is extracted. Our focus is on the data itself!

### URL ❌

Removed due to individuality and lack of contribution to our analysis. We're building a united and relevant front!
