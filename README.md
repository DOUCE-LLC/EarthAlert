## Machine Learning Marvels 🎯🔮

At the heart of TerraSafe lie two remarkable machine learning systems, each designed to address specific earthquake-related challenges. Let's explore them: 🌀🛠️

### 1. Sinusoidal Regression 📈🌐

Our first wonder is the Sinusoidal Regression model! 🌐 By analyzing cyclical earthquake behavior over specific areas, this system allows governments and organizations to determine whether it's the opportune time to invest in infrastructure and early warning systems or prepare for aid and potential reconstruction. Harness the power of the sine waves to foresee the seismic future! 🌌🔮

## 🚀 Getting Started with TerraSafe Project 🌍

Below are the simple steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terrasafe.git
```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Change your working directory to the TerraSafe project folder:

```bash
cd terrasafe
```

3. **Create Virtual Environment (Optional)**: While not mandatory, it is highly recommended to create a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated. Use the following command to create a virtual environment (you must have `virtualenv` installed):

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- For Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- For macOS and Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. **Install Dependencies**: Now, let's install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Run TerraSafe Web Platform**: With all the dependencies installed, you can now launch the TerraSafe Web Platform using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

6. **Explore TerraSafe**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access TerraSafe Web Platform. Now you have full access to our powerful earthquake data science tools and analysis at your fingertips! 🌐🚀
